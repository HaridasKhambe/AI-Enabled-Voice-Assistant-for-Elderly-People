# AI-Enabled Voice Assistant â€“ Sentiment Analysis Module

## Overview
This repository contains my contribution to a larger AI-enabled voice assistant project designed for elderly people. The focus of my work was **sentiment analysis** to enhance empathetic and context-aware interactions in Hindi.

The sentiment module plays a critical role in detecting emotions from user speech (converted to text), enabling the assistant to respond appropriately and improve user engagement.

## Sentiment Analysis Features
- **Domain-Specific Dataset** â€“ Curated Hindi dialogues reflecting elderly communication contexts.
- **Multi-Emotion Classification** â€“ Supports classification into five primary emotional categories.
- **Sarcasm Awareness** â€“ Handles indirect and sarcastic expressions to improve accuracy.
- **Robust Preprocessing** â€“ Tokenization, normalization, and text cleaning tailored for Hindi.
- **Optimized Performance** â€“ Balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for real-world usage.

## My Contribution
- **Dataset Creation** â€“ Curated and labeled a 51,100-sample Hindi dialogue dataset across 5 emotions:
  - `0`: Anger  
  - `1`: Joy  
  - `2`: Sadness  
  - `3`: Suspense  
  - `4`: Neutral  
- **Model Development** â€“ Implemented and trained:
  - **BiLSTM + Attention** â€“ Achieved 84.73% accuracy
  - **Fine-tuned IndicBERT** â€“ Achieved 83.71% accuracy
- **Sarcasm Handling** â€“ Improved detection of sarcastic expressions in Hindi.
- **Performance** â€“ Balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for robust real-world performance.

## High-Level Architecture
- **STT**: Converts spoken Hindi to text.
- **Sentiment Analysis Module** (my work): Detects emotion category.
- **Response Generation**: Generates context-aware Hindi text.
- **TTS**: Outputs speech in a cloned family voice.
